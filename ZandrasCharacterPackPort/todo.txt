Wingcat
	??? how to make this interestint ?
		mehri had some ideas for a long-range pounce
		I've been thinking actual flight mechanics, lift, momentum, stall
	reset graphics on pipe spitout
		done
	... a mechanical change ? effects ?
		hands ?
	
Psychic
	start/winconditions:
		starts in depths
			done
		"Your restplace is collapsing."
			depths blocked off by void fluid ?
		"Find a new place where rest and attunement can be achieved"
		no echos ?
		dead iterators ?
		no rests ?
			one cycle from depths
			after win can play cycle from fp
				thats quite limiting isnt it

		win condition: altar in top of FP
			near the 5 balls, the 5 balls themselves
			need dream to hint to win condition
				dream of self metitating on top of the center ball
				zoom out panel showing the location
			win sequence panels ?
				edited dream, happy
				"between the clouds"
				
	drag self causes stacking stun, stun too high causes failed drag
	movement impairement of the sorts ?
	lethal impact damage to self and others ?
		done
		
	could rework this into a mouse-only cat
		drag self across map
		... in one cycle no rests ?

	item usage restrictions or rework ? disable grab ?
		controls are a bit weird rn with directionals + zxc + mouse
			should either get rid of directionals or grab/jump/throw
		
Vult
	boring af rn 
	what do
	
	tameable vultures

	vulture nest rooms ?

	its a vulture baby trying to escape its mom and the mom keeps bringing it back to the nest
		
	spawns in East CC
		
	hunter difficulty ?
		
	play around the fact that he needs to eat meat but everything runs away from him so the player has to be smart about it
		low mobility, or maybe other things are artificially faster ?
		needs to eat lots ?

	pounce attack ? replaces grab/throw ?
		
	when looking away, mask has no effect ?
		
	win condition: tamed a King in sky islands ?
		thats kinda silly isnt it
		
Aquaria
	hydration/wetness system ?
		blue pips, no custom data = lazy way out
		custom save thing with slugbased ?
	dipping on water or catching rain wets you up
	wetness lasts severa cycles
	dies if unwet ?
	starvation mode if unwet ?
	start ?
		shoreline ?
		leviathan cave ?
	mission ?
		restore power/neurons to some of old Moon's rooms underwater ? that'd be a lot of room-making
	endgame ?

	Alright maybe the entire fucking world is underwater, how about that
		Up to the height of Chimney or smth
	
Skittlecat
	making this rainbow quest thing will be work but seems worth it, go
	spawns in GW or HI or DS ?
	win condition: has seen all the rainbows
		save tracking + counter on sleepscreen or smth
		maybe make it fast to certain rare rainbows cant be missed
		100% chance rainbows
