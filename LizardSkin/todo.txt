-properly do rotation
	somewhat done, could use a bit of dynamic layering in some assets but its ok
	head rotation could track looking-at, blends in for z < 0.1 (z = 0 = center of face, then up to center of head, then down spine)
	better smoother blending of direction between body-tail bit
- Slugcat menu preview
	load sprites, correct distances and thicknesses
	follow rotation
	reflect FancySlugs
	pick matching slugcat for basecolor and fancy stuff ? how ?

	(grabbed by a white liz tongue - topaz)
	Jolly player-grabbing-player also messes things up
	It was fancy, had ANOTHER override on addtocontainer
	fixed in 0.7
		
with expedition the liz accessiories are slucat's color (topaz)
	needs special compatibilification or poke lee about it.
	attempted fix in 0.7, can't bother to check
	
the antennaes kinda go off slugcat. segment too long = huge offset from sluggy (topaz)
	couldn't reproduce wont fix ?

freaky scales when going fast (some cosmetics call reset when too far ? thought I fixed this, maybe its something else, do they bend backwards maybe ?)

the cosmetic colour isn't dulling out when in starving state
	I think adding a setting for the cosmetic colour to inherit slugcat's menu colours could be a possible fix
		a "base collor as effect" option could solve that, making it use fancy's slugcatcolor for the effect

crash CM with high seeds, 4-digits long seed works, 5 or more will break ? luna in my dms, reports 21/09/2021 in modding support
	maxLength gets calculated on init, proceeds to trim defaultvalue, causes onchange before ctor returned, causes nullref
	maxLength seems unused btw
	solved by zeroing defaultvalue and assigning it after ctor
	done in 0.7
