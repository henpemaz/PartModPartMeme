-properly do rotation
	somewhat done, could use a bit of dynamic layering in some assets but its ok
	head rotation could track looking-at, blends in for z < 0.1 (z = 0 = center of face, then up to center of head, then down spine)
	better smoother blending of direction between body-tail bit
- Slugcat menu preview
	load sprites, correct distances and thicknesses
	follow rotation
	
feature requests:
	layering option for all default/behind/behindhead/ontop
	flip scales
	better head-tracking for antennae
	SpinePos and Angle settings for the gills
	spinepos on antennae to minus values (or have zero be higher)
	SpinePos and lenght for Spinespikes
	Better smoother interpolation between tail and body direction

void sea spawns antena zooms through screen missing a position reset or smth https://youtu.be/IXIaptekU34

gecko scales needs to be adjustable where it starts
	done in 0.6
TailGeckoScales used to be shinier, more reflective, what changed (mehri)
make the large tail gecko scales multicolored, like with actual cyans (bigabyte)
	done in 0.6
	
top row of color selectors break in scrollbox (several)
	done in 0.6
		
having a tail[] != 4 causes issues for updaterotation and probably spineposition
	done in 0.7
	
customtails messes around with my trimeshes (customtails + antennae) (mehri)
	customtails update shall fix it soon
	
Have to switch tabs for profile name to save (me)
editing filters checkboxes doesnt trigger CM save (me)	
	
graphic selector went to 7 somehow despite the limit and bluescreened (sunshine, foxy too)
Int upandown causes bluescreen still, I've patched out the event but i'll still be read by other events (topaz)
Can type in invalid values and it reads them
	maybe possibly fixed in 0.7
	
add selector for rendering on top, behindhead, behind, particularly for headstuff (mehri)
	
bitten by a lizard causes layer freakout (several)
	(grabbed by a white liz tongue - topaz)
	Jolly player-grabbing-player also messes things up

	
new profile seems to duplicate ? (topaz) nonreproduceable, missing steps
	
freaky scales when going fast (some cosmetics call reset when too far ? thought I fixed this, maybe its something else, do they bend backwards maybe ?)
	
with expedition the liz accessiories are slucat's color (topaz)
	needs special compatibilification or poke lee about it.
	
the antennaes kinda go off slugcat. segment too long = huge offset from sluggy (topaz)

the cosmetic colour isn't dulling out when in starving state
	I think adding a setting for the cosmetic colour to inherit slugcat's menu colours could be a possible fix
		a "base collor as effect" option could solve that, making it use fancy's slugcatcolor for the effect
