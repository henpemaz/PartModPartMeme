My Rain World modding projects

Some have to-dos, some even have comments! Feel free to reach me over on discord if you want to contribute or make derivative works.

Special thanks to:
- Thalber - Lots of contributions in ConcealedGarden and Lizardskin and ShelterBehaviors code :purple_heart:
- SlimeCubed - General advice while I was working on several of these, also the creator of Slugbase (framework for programmercat) and AttachedFields.cs
- Casheww - Contributed a proper string input method into ManagedPlacedObjects, tysm

Notes about usage:
- Feel free to use copy improve modify and distribute the following files:
  - CustomSpritesLoader/CustomAtlasLoader.cs (a good chunk of it is code straigth from the videogame, one day I'll find a more elegant solution)
  - ManagedPlacedObjects/PlacedObjectsManager.cs (there's a more complete version over at the RegionKit repo)
- For anything else, please ask first :)
