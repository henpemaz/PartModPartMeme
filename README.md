# PartModPartMeme

This repo is for the 1.5 version of the game. Newer mods and Remix ports will be developed over at my RemixMods repo.

Please try and contact me through Github/Discord/Email about porting my 1.5 mods to Remix, and give me a month to answer, before trying to do the porting yourself.

## My Rain World modding projects

Some have to-dos, some even have comments! Feel free to reach me over on discord if you want to contribute or make derivative works.

Special thanks to:
- Thalber - Lots of contributions in ConcealedGarden and Lizardskin and ShelterBehaviors code :purple_heart:
- SlimeCubed - General advice while I was working on several of these, also the creator of Slugbase (framework for programmercat) and AttachedFields.cs
- Casheww - Contributed a proper string input method into ManagedPlacedObjects, tysm

Notes about usage:
- Feel free to use copy improve modify and distribute the following files:
  - CustomSpritesLoader/CustomAtlasLoader.cs (a good chunk of it is code straigth from the videogame, one day I'll find a more elegant solution)
  - ManagedPlacedObjects/PlacedObjectsManager.cs (there's a more complete version over at the RegionKit repo)
- For anything else, please ask first :)
