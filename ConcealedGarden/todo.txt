	Dream for traded pearl ?
	store "player ever picked up trader pearl", not persistent

notes on echo songs
	else I
		opens up in single low voice, persistant, ever so slightly oscilating in volume
		at 14 medium voice joins, cuts at 28
		melody is long continuous notes
		at 36 medium and high chores join
		high chore does a melody, medium becomes calm harmonic fill
		high melody feels maybe a bit more detailed
		fist phrase is 36 ~ 1:20
		second phrase is 1:30 ~ 2:20
		2:25 ~
		3:00 ~
		
		low fill,
		medium intro into fill
		high melody
		
		voices had a metalic high noise
		
	else II
		opens up on a low tone that oscilates, cuts off, comes back, lowers pitch etc etc
			feels like a wind instrument all things considered
		has a high-pitched noise from reverb
		
		high voice joins at 20, melodic, fleeting, non continuous
		melody is short notes
		first phrase is 20 ~ 36
		
		medium voices at 48, similar melody
		at 1:25 high voices join, moooostly unison but different distortions
		medium voice simplifies over time ?
		20~36 high only
		48~1:25 medium only
		1:25~2:13 medium + high
		2:19~2:50 medium only
		
		constant low from wind instrument, breath-in pauses
	
	else III
		opens up in medium/low voice doing a melody
		very high-pitched reverb noise doesn't follow the main voice precisely ?? added on its own
		voice solos 0~40
		40 high voice joins low, same melody
		phrase 1 40~1:00
		low keeps going
		1:08 high joins again, goes more complex
		1:46
		1:50 joins again, calmer
		2:02 calm
		2:06 low solo
		
	else IV
		opens with smooth low
		12 smooth medium joins
		there's a noise instrument around
		34 medium voice pitches up
		44 there's strings ???
		melody is long, sparse notes
		1:03 high voice joins, same smooth voice/pad
		
		could study this better its sort of unique
	
	else V
		opens with wind instrument, low
		14: voices join, high is strong, does a melody, low stays calmly, high fades
		high: short melody
		low: harmonic fill along instrument,
		medium: intermitent fill when high ends
		1:05: medium-high joins
		1:13: high-high flirts
		
		1:30 melody changes
		1:38 medium starts a melody, high follows, 2 semitones down
		1:50 semitone up
		
		tone returns to normal, high back on lead
		2:40 low and medium chorus together now ?
		3:00 end of melodies, wind only until 3:28
		
	else VI
		opens on distorted medium voice, high-pitched annoying metalic reverb
		tapping noises in the mix, part of the sample ??
		has a ton of reverb
		12 pause, breath
		16 low joins, this is medium+low as fill
		low has no tapping
		24 high pitch joins, melody is long notes, well-paused
		notes have tapping but it overlaps rythmically
		1st phrase is 24~48
		on pause, only low keeps going
		57 starts again
		this is two voices
		
		1:50 melody ends,
		2:10 distortion high pitch noises
		2:20 melody high voice, heavily filtered
		2:35 sound fill with wind ?? absurd reverb/distance
