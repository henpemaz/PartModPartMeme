echo song
	listen to all echo songs again, count voices, mark actions, judge melodies

extra song for tree area

region bump sfx

piano song for trailer, can reuse in cutcontent area

progression filter for song
	so not running into songfx while song playing ?

rework progression filtering into something like a framework ? extendable expansable

if CM not done by oct 08, migrate progression system

Tree arena
	wip

The trader sometimes leaves its post, happened ever since added more scavs
ClimbableRope - grab on going out of crawlspace
HI_CG gate maybe a tad too complex
DS_CG gate broken and I doubt LB will fix it

in-region gates are iffy
hidden area too well hidden ?

Go through HI with devtools open, study light, triggers, sounds
judge wether there's too much Signs in CG

dream triggers seemed iffy from code, check if it works

crazy idea but... expand treetop, finish implemnting cablecar, connect to... ?

Lore pearl from trader
