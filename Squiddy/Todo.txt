	Grab
		done
		needs to be able to hunt down batflies
			uses playercode
			
		grab most items
		iplayeredibles -> ok to bite

		swallow regurgitate, for neurons

		if dash with a weapon, on collision throw? connedted chunk hit

		grab tiny insects for eating
			room.insectcoordinator.allinsects
			make temp fisobj

		grabbing puffball = bad ):

		should maybe use bittenbyplayer on most stuff when applicable ?
			turns out just using foodpoints is fine, used for autoeating in shelters too!

	Right now narrow-space movement is super slow
		on pair with vanilla squids though they do be like that
		maybe pipe-corner boosting or something like that ?

	Collision damage ?
	"Annoying" grab ?

	Eat, or stash ?
	Shelters or Dens ?
		maybe:
			"eats" in Den on a short timer
			needs to be able to enter those
			watch out for rain/damage thing stuck

			visual indicator of den? <---------------------
				shortcutgraphics
					done
				or iggy points towards it ?
					hologram system seems a mess but could make it work

			if rain timer going off, can sleep in a den, gains no karma <---------------------
			if sleep in shelter gains karma

			grab tiny tiny tiny prey? eat for quarter ?
				but batflies are so common already >.>

			WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CARRYING DEN-WORTHY FOOD TO A SHELTER??
				should consider it in the maths of closing the shelter
				should eat it properly/
