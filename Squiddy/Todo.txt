	Exist
		Done

	Dash
	Scoot
	Move
		Done

	Movement near long poles = refuses to move depending on placement

	Arena mode bugged can't enter shelters

	Cannot hit pole plant, no collision lol

	Update controll mapping description :)

	Grab
		done
		needs to be able to hunt down batflies
			uses playercode
			
		grab most items
		iplayeredibles -> ok to bite

		swallow regurgitate, for neurons

		if dash with a weapon, on collision throw? connedted chunk hit

		grab tiny insects for eating
			room.insectcoordinator.allinsects
			make temp fisobj

		grabbing puffball = bad ):

		should maybe use bittenbyplayer on most stuff when applicable ?
			turns out just using foodpoints is fine, used for autoeating in shelters too!

	Right now narrow-space movement is super slow
		on pair with vanilla squids though they do be like that
		maybe pipe-corner boosting or something like that ?

	Collision damage ?
	"Annoying" grab ?

	Eat, or stash ?
	Shelters or Dens ?
		maybe:
			"eats" in Den on a short timer
			needs to be able to enter those
			watch out for rain/damage thing stuck

			visual indicator of den?
				shortcutgraphics
					done
				or iggy points towards it ?
					hologram system seems a mess but could make it work

			if rain timer going off, can sleep in a den, gains no karma <---------------------
			if sleep in shelter gains karma

			grab tiny tiny tiny prey? eat for quarter ?
				but batflies are so common already >.>

			WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CARRYING DEN-WORTHY FOOD TO A SHELTER??
				should consider it in the maths of closing the shelter
				should eat it properly

	Make shelters work
	Player dies when you die
	Ui and map
	Patch up Swimming so control isn't lost
		done

	Karma starts at capped at 1
		echo in outskirts puts it at 3
	or starts at 3 but no echo, probably heaps easier and still interesting
		or hitting "survivor" unlocks more karma ?

	Five pebbles
		(changedspecial crosshair dashing around on screen)
		(triggers stun)
		BAM (gives mark and karma)
		... wait no that was the wrong thing
		How did you get in in the first place, stupid creature.
		Just be gone with you before I turn you into a blue goop

		(throwouts go by in quick succession, much faster than usual)

		I'm not kidding. I'll mess you up.

		(actually turns you into a blue goop if you stay too long)


		newaction meetwhite -> meetwhite behavior and then there the magic happens
			meetwhitebehavior handles everything, including custom givemark
			shocked = start
			curious = brings up crosshair and aims around
			texting = aims at player, minigame, stuns player if taking too long
			images = give mark?
			jumps to convo

			does throwout replace dialogue in addevents?
