patching needed so far:
futile -> turn on splitscreen mode -> done

rwgame -> actually create cam2, cam1 follow p1 fix, cam2 follow play2 added -> done
cam -> turn on splitscreen mode, fix name of sprites for each cam -> done
shortcuthandler -> follow p2 between rooms added, crtl-c'd from p1 -> done
level shader coord fix -> done
might wanna consider vertical split -> done
fix map/ map shaders -> done
any more shaders to fix?							????
fix menu -> done
fix cam transitions -> done
fix room loading -> done
fix shutdown / memleek
	return to single cam -> done
	make weakrefs? -< made cleanup
test with Jolly
	disabled map rotation when 2p, seems fine otherwise
fix pause menu
	how? duplicate and offset? -> done
fix screen of dead slug stops -> done
fix rain -> done
	breaks on horiz split????						????
fix text popups -> hud moved
fix culling -> done
test water
	fix water -> done
fix sounds
	water sounds super annoying
		done???
test text boxes -> done
test ending -> god fucking damn it jolly -> fixed
test with voxel
	breaks *violently*

test with scrollmod
	needs fix bounds -> done
	needs fix offset -> done
	needs fix reset/recalc (wont do, fix your code schbun)

on split, do players go to player-number positions, or do they take the position they were closest to graphics wise?

make zoom level adjustable?

2 windows? -> unity wont cooperate? display class is there just wont work

possible optimizations
	on collapse kill roomcam2, or somehow disable it, reduced processing
		can't rn because un-moved sprites are in the field of view damn it
	on single-cam game, don't create listener, don't set shader variables
