climbablepoleH
climbablearc
oneendedrope
	done and released in v1
	
doubleendedrope
consumable 1-end-stuck rope
	
CHAINS texture
VINES texture
SOUND for swinging, vars for chains vines etc.
	
notes:
	also probably an option to make ropes/arcs/poles look less clean
	to compensate for lack of normal devtools effects
	random bumps here and there, very slight color variation of segments
		
	option to add wind effect to the ropes?
	the bendy poles should just have the same controls as normal poles if possible, theres a bunch of stuff you can do with them, also the invisibility option is a great idea. idk about the ropes though those probably need to be their own thing
	it would be nice, also i think it looks. Abit weird that doesn't have slime or rust but I don't think is possible to fix that so as far i see from the poles, are pretty coo

port to MPO?
add color select option
physics sliders
can jump from arc (currently does a weak jump)

IMPORTANT crawling from crawspace into rope should auto-grab
