done:
	extra doors identical to vanilla
	"hold down to trigger" behavior and tutorial
	trigger/notrigger zones
	consumable shelter
	control over frames to trigger, to starve, to sleep, to go to sleep screen
	api for making animated shelter parts

shelters with no vanilla doors
	maybe by default so door placement is easier to control

bad door placement causes infinite loop on ctor, specially in open rooms

extra spawn positions
	broken, fix it
		done ?
shelter rain/rumble
	see BSH
		actually see CG rain fix
the rest of the BSH features ?


validate behavior with door
validate behavior with multi-door
	should manager manage that too ?
	prevent vanilla calling close/starve/win/etc, then do it from manager so to follow the timings ?
	change the speed at which doors animate to match timings ?
shelter rain object
	from CG (:
the other shelter-rumble-thinghie from BSH?
anything else from BSH?
