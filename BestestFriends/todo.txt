alt sleepscreen art for when sleeping with friend lizard ?
can the cat layer be tinted ingame
	live2d unity sdk export
	needs unity 5.2 ??? fuck
	backporting it seemed like it would be hell because of the graphics pipeline thing in code that its used for clipping masks
	
maybe expand the scope to more than one lizard ? requires lots of art
	could have just some sparse combos for the player to find 
		
squicada sleeping screen
tiny centipede ?
	
get that one artpiece in, check for matching md5(steamuserid)
